# Cube Labs 3D Changelog

This file records meaningful product, architecture, security, database, deployment, and documentation changes. Small mechanical edits may remain in Git history.

## 2026-07-22 — Branch documentation recovery and project health

- Author: OpenAI GPT working with the project owner
- Branch: `main`
- Purpose: recover unique documentation from stale or diverged branches without falsely marking branch-only code as shipped.
- Added: `SOCIAL-AND-MULTIPLAYER.md`, `CUBE-ENGINE.md`, `PROJECT-HEALTH.md`, and `checkpoints/2026-07-22-password-reset-preview.md`.
- Consolidated: the two overlapping social/multiplayer checklists from `feature/social-challenges-foundation` into one permanent plan.
- Recovered: NxN tracked-state design notes from `claude/cube-engine-centering-zb2e9m`; explicitly classified corresponding implementation as branch-only pending verification or selective porting.
- Preserved: password-reset preview deployment trigger from `gpt/cube-id-platform` as a historical checkpoint.
- Updated: documentation index, current status, roadmap, and daily check-in log.
- Testing: verified branch comparisons, source-document reads, and successful GitHub writes; no runtime application code changed.
- Deployment: documentation-only changes on `main`.
- Known follow-up: verify solver implementation states, decide whether to port NxN tracked-state code, and reconcile the social prototype only after defining a versioned puzzle-state contract.
- Rollback: revert these documentation commits; not recommended because the recovered branch knowledge would again be scattered and easy to lose.

## 2026-07-22 — Current-status and daily check-in system

- Author: OpenAI GPT working with the project owner
- Branch: `main`
- Purpose: replace scattered current-state assumptions with one verified status document, one canonical roadmap, and a repeatable daily check-in process.
- Added: `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DAILY-LOG.md`, and `checkpoints/README.md`.
- Updated: documentation index and required documentation workflow.
- Checklist policy: roadmap items are checked only when repository evidence and required documentation support completion.
- Historical policy: old status files are preserved as checkpoints but cannot override current permanent documents.
- Testing: documentation paths and repository writes were verified through GitHub; no runtime application code changed.
- Deployment: documentation-only changes on `main`.
- Known follow-up: inspect current 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 implementation and tests to replace unverified or partial roadmap statuses with exact evidence-backed results.
- Rollback: revert the documentation commits; not recommended because the new files resolve missing links and establish the requested daily project control system.

## 2026-07-22 — Documentation governance foundation

- Author: OpenAI GPT working with the project owner
- Branch: `main`
- Purpose: establish the permanent `/docs` source-of-truth structure and enforce correct documentation and change logging.
- Added: documentation index, project constitution, architecture rules, AI instructions, admin portal specification, and backup/migration strategy.
- Structural rule: contributors must follow the documented structure and log meaningful changes in the correct permanent documents.
- Testing: verified repository write access and successful GitHub commits for each new document.
- Deployment: documentation-only change; no runtime behavior changed.
- Known follow-up: add the remaining feature-specific documents and fold older checkpoint notes into permanent documents or an archive index.
- Rollback: revert the documentation commits; not recommended because these files define required project governance.

## Earlier project history summary

The repository history and existing checkpoint documents record earlier work including:

- mobile-first homepage and interactive hero cube;
- playable 3×3 and larger NxN cube work;
- solver and cube-rendering fixes;
- mobile viewport and high-DPI canvas fixes;
- Pyraminx implementation;
- Supabase database and authentication foundation;
- Cube ID profile and social platform foundation;
- early community, friendship, challenge, and leaderboard planning;
- Vercel branch deployments and environment configuration.

These entries will be expanded as older progress documents are reviewed and consolidated.
