# Cube Labs 3D Changelog

This file records meaningful product, architecture, security, database, deployment, and documentation changes. Small mechanical edits may remain in Git history.

## 2026-07-22 — Current-status and daily check-in system

- Author: OpenAI GPT working with the project owner
- Branch: `main`
- Purpose: replace scattered current-state assumptions with one verified status document, one canonical roadmap, and a repeatable daily check-in process.
- Added: `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DAILY-LOG.md`, and `checkpoints/README.md`.
- Updated: documentation index and required documentation workflow.
- Checklist policy: roadmap items are checked only when repository evidence and required documentation support completion.
- Historical policy: old status files are preserved as checkpoints but cannot override current permanent documents.
- Testing: documentation paths and repository writes were verified through GitHub; no runtime application code changed.
- Deployment: documentation-only changes on `main`.
- Known follow-up: inspect current 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 implementation and tests to replace unverified or partial roadmap statuses with exact evidence-backed results.
- Rollback: revert the documentation commits; not recommended because the new files resolve missing links and establish the requested daily project control system.

## 2026-07-22 — Documentation governance foundation

- Author: OpenAI GPT working with the project owner
- Branch: `main`
- Purpose: establish the permanent `/docs` source-of-truth structure and enforce correct documentation and change logging.
- Added: documentation index, project constitution, architecture rules, AI instructions, admin portal specification, and backup/migration strategy.
- Structural rule: contributors must follow the documented structure and log meaningful changes in the correct permanent documents.
- Testing: verified repository write access and successful GitHub commits for each new document.
- Deployment: documentation-only change; no runtime behavior changed.
- Known follow-up: add the remaining feature-specific documents and fold older checkpoint notes into permanent documents or an archive index.
- Rollback: revert the documentation commits; not recommended because these files define required project governance.
