# Cube Labs 3D — Master Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-07-22

This is the canonical project checklist. Items are checked only when repository evidence and required documentation support completion.

> **Latest merge (2026-07-22):** `main` was fast-forwarded to `76f244d`, folding in Cube ID / password reset / Cube Labs Mail (from `gpt/cube-id-platform`), the homepage-matched `/auth` sign-in (from `gpt/current-site-state`), and the 4×4 + interim-5×5 + 3×3-manual-entry solvers (from `claude/new-session-euaf6s`). Build passes. Items below marked `[~]` are merged but await production verification and/or the two Supabase migrations. See `CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the branch registry and `CHANGELOG.md` for details.

## Status key

- `[x]` verified complete on the canonical branch
- `[~]` merged to `main` but unverified, branch-only, or awaiting a migration
- `[?]` reported but not yet verified against current code and tests
- `[ ]` incomplete

## Status & tracking rules

These rules keep this list trustworthy. Read them before checking any box.

1. **`main` is the only source of truth.** An item is `[x]` only when it is on `main` **and** verified. Work living on any other branch is at most `[~]`, and must name the branch.
2. **Every checked item names its evidence** — a file/route, a commit/PR, a migration, or a recorded browser/device test. No evidence → not checked.
3. **Migrations gate the checkbox.** A feature needing a SQL migration stays `[~]` until the migration is confirmed run in production and recorded in `DAILY-LOG.md`.
4. **Build ≠ verified.** A green build earns `[~]`, not `[x]`. `[x]` needs the real behavior confirmed (browser/device) where a user can see it.
5. **Log every status change** in `DAILY-LOG.md` as one line: item, old→new status, commit/PR, date.
6. **Keep the branch registry current** (in `CURRENT_STATUS.md`): every active branch has a purpose and a merge state, so nothing is lost or accidentally re-merged.
7. **Never `git merge` a RootB branch** (`drive-homepage-import`, `fix/cube-transform-stability`, `feature/social-challenges-foundation`) — no shared history. Port wanted work by hand.
8. **When in doubt, mark it lower.** Honest `[~]`/`[ ]` beats an optimistic `[x]` (Constitution §12).
9. **Reconcile on sight.** If code and these docs disagree, fix it the same session — neither may stay silently stale (docs `README` §Structure enforcement).
